# Software Defined Vehicle -- A Sketch

This example implements a sketch of how a software-defined vehicle (SDV) could be designed. It uses a browser for the dashboard display, keyboard input for user commands, and sound generation for auditory feedback. For example, the browser displays the following when a front obstacle is close to the vehicle, accompanied by an audible alert:

</tr>
