# Keyboard Input

While it is easy to write a portable C program that responds to keyboard input after the Return or Enter key is pressed, it is not so easy to write a portable program that responds to any key press immediately. This example shows how to use the ncurses library, which is reasonably portable, to achive this sort of keyboard input.
