/**
 * This Lingua Franca program demonstrates a federated reactor system that integrates a sender and a
 * receiver, both interfacing with the Robot Operating System (ROS). The sender periodically
 * publishes "Hello World" messages to a ROS topic, while the receiver listens to the same topic and
 * processes incoming messages. The federated design ensures that the sender's output is directed to
 * the receiver's input, creating a communication link between the two. It showcases the ability of
 * Lingua Franca to support modular, distributed, real-time systems where different components
 * interact and communicate seamlessly.
